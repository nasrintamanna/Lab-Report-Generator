# Lab-Report-Generator
Many students around the world studying science whether it is biology, chemistry, or physics are sometimes faced with the dilemma and challenge of writing science lab reports. Such challenges include not being able to know the right format for writing a science lab report, the word count limit for each section of the report, or the type of information that needs to be included per section of the report. 
The lab report generator system is programmed to provide students with guidelines for the information that needs to be included in each section of the report. The system  contains a word count subsystem for each section of the report to guide students on the number limit of words needed per section. The sections which are included in the lab report generator include- 1. The lab report title, 2. the statement of the problem or the research question, 3. Hypothesis, 4. The variables during the lab experiment, 5. Materials used for the experiment, 6. The methods by which the experiment was conducted, 7. Picture(s) of the lab experiment set up, 8. The data results of the experiment should be represented in a line chart, 9. The Conclusion. Information received from the user for each section of the lab report is written in the lab report pdf file that will be generated for the user. Interactive GUI features are also included in the lab report generator to make the user interface friendly.
